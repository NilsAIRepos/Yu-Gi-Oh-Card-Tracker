# Dashboard

The Dashboard is the landing page of OpenYuGi. It provides a high-level overview of your collection and quick access to all major features.

## 1. Header & Collection Selection
At the top right of the dashboard, you will find the **Collection Selector**.

## 2. Collection Metrics
This section displays key statistics for the currently selected collection:
- **Unique Cards**: The number of distinct card titles you own.

- **Completion**: The percentage of the total known card database that you own at least one copy of.
