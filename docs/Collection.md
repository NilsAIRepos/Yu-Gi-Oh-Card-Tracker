## 1. Views
You can toggle between two main viewing modes using the buttons in the header:

### Consolidated View
- **Purpose**: Best for gameplay and deck building.
- **Display**: Groups all printings of a card together. If you own 3x "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" from LOB and 2x from SDK, this view shows one "Blue-Eyes White Dragon" entry with a total owned count of 5.
- **Tooltips**: Hovering over a card shows the highest-resolution image available.

### Collectors View
- **Purpose**: Best for collectors and trading.
- **Display**: Lists every specific printing separately. You will see separate entries for "LOB-001 (Ultra Rare)" and "SDK-001 (Ultra Rare)".

## 2. Display Modes
